Run "python main_train6D.py" for training.

Visualize Results
------
* Run "python gui6D.py" to generate the interface to visualize 3D slice of the learned boundary in 6D.
* Use "Random Pick" button to randomly slice on the current three active dimensions.
* You can choose to adjust new 3 dimensions by choosing 3 out of the 6 checkboxs and click "Config Dimensions". 
* Adjust "Inclusive radius" to filter a set points from all of the data by how far that point is from the slicing point in the 3 active dimension.
